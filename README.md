# League Patch Collection â€“ Vanguard Disabler & QOL Optimizer for League Client

**League Patch Collection** is a lightweight C# application designed for Windows to enhance your League of Legends experience. This tool introduces several quality-of-life features and optimizations League Client experience. See command line arguments additional options.

>  Unlike most third party tools, this app does NOT use the Riot Client or LCU api. Instead it hooks into backend protocals like XMPP (chat), Websocket (RMS) and https (Ledge).

## Features

> As of January 9th this play without vanguard bypass has been **partially patched**. If you try to play without Vanguard, **you may get kicked (Vanguard Event) and get leaver busted**.

By default, this app provides the following enhancements:

## Pull requests needed

Pull requests are always welcome. Also, if anyone knows a library or easy way to decode Riot's rtmp (they use action message format) please contact me **c4t_bot** on Discord. I cannot find any c# libraries for decoding AMF0, AMF3 which is needed to proxy RTMP for lobby revealer. For reference here is a [good article](https://web-xbaank.vercel.app/blog/Reversing-engineering-lol) that describes how a lobby revealer works.
