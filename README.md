## Command-Line Arguments

You can enhance the functionality further by using command-line arguments when running the app. Here's how to use them:

### Arguments
- `--usevgk`:  Disables vanguard bypass feature.
- `--legacyhonor`: Reverts the honor system to its pre-patch 14.9 state, removing the option to honor enemies.

### Running with Arguments

#### Windows:
You can use a shortcut to easily run the app with arguments:

1. Right-click the `league-patch-collection.exe` file and select **Create Shortcut**.
2. Right-click the newly created shortcut and select **Properties**.
3. In the **Target** field, add the desired argument(s) at the end. For example: "C:\Path\To\league-patch-collection.exe" --usevgk --legacyhonor
4. Click **OK** to save the changes.
5. Use this shortcut to run the app with your specified arguments.

#### macOS:
1. Open Terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder where the app is located:
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```
3. Run the app with the desired argument. For example:
    ```bash
    ./mac-league-patch-collection --legacyhonor
    ```

## Installation and Usage

Before running the application, make sure you have the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed. If not, download and install it from the link.

### Windows
Run the league-patch-collection.exe file directly, or use the shortcut method (as described above) to apply arguments

### macOS
macOS can be pretty restrictive with apps outside of the App Store, so follow these steps to get the app running:

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the app:
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```
2. Make the file executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x mac-league-patch-collection
    ```
3. Because macOS treats anything not from the App Store like it's a virus (thanks, Gatekeeper), you need to disable Gatekeeper:
    ```bash
    sudo spctl --master-disable
    ```
4. Once Gatekeeper is disabled, you can run the app:
    ```bash
    ./mac-league-patch-collection
    ```

If you want, you can turn Gatekeeper back on with a simple command:
```bash
sudo spctl --master-enable
```
## Pull requests needed

Pull requests are always welcome. Also, if anyone knows a library or easy way to decode Riot's rtmp (they use action message format) please contact me **c4t_bot** on Discord. I cannot find any c# libraries for decoding AMF0, AMF3 which is needed to proxy RTMP for lobby revealer. For reference here is a [good article](https://web-xbaank.vercel.app/blog/Reversing-engineering-lol) that describes how a lobby revealer works.
