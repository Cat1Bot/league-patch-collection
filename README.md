## Pull requests needed

Pull requests are always welcome. Also, if anyone knows a library or easy way to decode Riot's rtmp (they use action message format) please contact me **c4t_bot** on Discord. I cannot find any c# libraries for decoding AMF0, AMF3 which is needed to proxy RTMP for lobby revealer. For reference here is a [good article](https://web-xbaank.vercel.app/blog/Reversing-engineering-lol) that describes how a lobby revealer works.
